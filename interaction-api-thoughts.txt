Currently we prompt the user with a list of transitions and get back an
index into that transition list.

We could expose this by making exec a functor over a signature including

prompt : transition list * context -> transition option

and then populate that w/things like a repl, a context renderer +
keystrokes that send none unless there's one in the buffer...

if we get none, quiesce the stage
and if we get some, run the transition and then quiesce? or keep going til
  no more transitions exist?
